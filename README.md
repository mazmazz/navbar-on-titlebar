# Nav Bar on Title Bar

This addon allows you to move the navigation bar (or "address bar") up to the title bar when it was
previously not possible, not unlike tabs-on-top in Firefox or Chrome. Before, Firefox would keep the
navigation bar on its own row when tabs were on the bottom. Now you can save a toolbar's worth of
space (approx. 25 pixels) and enjoy more vertical page visibility!

**This addon was last released in 2011 and is unsupported!** It was designed for Firefox 4 and 5;
later versions are untested.

## Features

* Supports both large and small icons
* Has a configurable option to keep the nav bar on top even when not maximized. (This benefits the tab bar when on top, too.)
* Has configurable side margins so you can have more space to right-click on the title bar or unmaximize the window.
* Plays nicely with full-screen, different toolbar arrangements, etc.

### Engagement

The title navbar concept was popular enough to generate community interest.

* [Tree Style Tab issue](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues/620) and [commit](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/commit/94946342354bbae6994b890d8914b9d5f12c38a9)
  that added compatibility support for Nav Bar on Title Bar.
* [Bugzilla feature request](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=767709) which proposed a
  native implementation of the title navbar (flagged WONTFIX).
